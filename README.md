## 👋 Hi, I am Noah
### 👨🏻‍💻Work
I am a Mobile Software Engineer📱 [@Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) working on the [Shopify Ping Team](https://www.shopify.com/ping) as we innovate conversational commerce. I mainly live on the frontier of [React Native development](https://shopify.engineering/react-native-future-mobile-shopify) as I buildout exceptional high quality cross-platform products at high speeds. In my past role, I focused mainly on just iOS development with Swift. I really just love everything 🍎!

### 🏂 Play
In my off time, I like to also build products and pursue entrepreneurial endeavors which include:

- Rethinking the gifting process to make sure nobody ever buys socks as a gift again with a mobile application
- Building out my personal website completely in React to help me learn(more on this soon!)
- Leading mobile development for [Equip Manage](https://equipmanage.com/) which helps gyms track broken equipment, warranties, and repairs
- In love with the game of Golf ⛳️
